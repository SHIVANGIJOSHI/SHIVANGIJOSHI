### Hi, I'm Shivangi Joshi 👋

I'm a Senior Software Developer Engineer with a passion for building efficient and scalable software systems. Over the past few years, I’ve delved deep into the world of microservices, optimized APIs, and tackled complex technical challenges across different domains. My journey in tech has been all about exploring new possibilities and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with code. Oh, and I still find joy in solving chess puzzles, diving into books, and losing myself in music. 🧩📚🎶

When I’m not busy coding or refining my skills, you’ll find me reading Sherlock Holmes or revisiting the magical world of Harry Potter. Yes, I’m a proud Potterhead and a fan of good ol' Sherlock Holmes! 🕵️‍♂️🧙‍♂️
