### Hi, I'm Shivangi Joshi 👋

I’m a Software Engineer by day, but you might also call me a bibliophile, astrophile, and artophile! 📚✨🎨


My tech journey so far has been a fantastic adventure and full of learning. I’m eager to share the insights and experiences I’ve picked up along the way. 🚀💻


Oh, and I still find joy in chess, sudoku, and mind-bending puzzles, diving into captivating books, exploring random science tidbits, painting, or losing myself in music. 🧩📚🎨🎶


I’d love to connect and chat about tech, hobbies, or anything else that piques your interest—let’s connect! 🌟
